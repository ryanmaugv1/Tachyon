# Tachyon ☄️
### **[!] This repo is discontinued and a new & improved one is being made called Oculorum!**

> `Note:` There are a lot of comments since this is the first time I programme programming a toy language and it is part of my learning process so that I can make a better language next time.

This is a language focused on being simple yet powerful and will change the way programmers will visualises and debugs code.
